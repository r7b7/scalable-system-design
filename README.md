# scalable-system-design
This repository contains multiple Spring Boot projects, each focusing on building a scalable component of an enterprise-grade application. Each project is designed to demonstrate best practices in scalability, performance, and fault tolerance.

Additionally, the repo includes a "papers" folder, which provides in-depth research and analysis on each scalable component, explaining its internal workings, design decisions, and real-world applicability.

Each document under "papers" folder analyzes one component / explains one project under the "code" folder. Document names are self-descriptive.

Ideal for developers, architects, and researchers looking to understand and implement scalable microservices and enterprise software patterns.
